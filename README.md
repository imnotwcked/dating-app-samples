ðŸ“„ Project Description: Tinder-Style Dating App (Test Version)
I created this Tinder-style dating app as a test project to explore mobile app development, backend integration, and real-time matchmaking. My goal was to build a fully functional dating platform that incorporates:

âœ… Swipe-based matching system (like/dislike profiles)
âœ… Real-time chat with WebSockets
âœ… Location-based user filtering
âœ… AI-powered matchmaking
âœ… Premium features (boosts, super likes, etc.)

ðŸš€ Why I Built This
I've always been interested in creating mobile apps and wanted to challenge myself by integrating full-stack development. This project gave me hands-on experience with:

Frontend: React Native (JavaScript)
Backend: Node.js (Express, MongoDB)
Real-time Features: WebSockets, Firebase Notifications
Payment System: Stripe API for premium users
Admin Dashboard & Analytics
